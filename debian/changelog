  * On IPv4-only systems, ensure that IO::Socket::INET is loaded properly by
    the connected_to() method.
  * Generate more expressive exception messages if public_ipv4()/public_ipv6()
    methods are called without the respective IP version being supported.
  * Made 'remote_address_ipv{4,6}_default' and 'remote_port_default' constants
    completely overridable from Net::Address::IP::Local sub-classes.
